# Aircraft Detection in Satellite Images using PCA and SVM

## Overview
This project uses Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction and Support Vector Machine (SVM) for classifying aircraft in satellite images. 

## Methodology
- **PCA** reduces high-dimensional image data while preserving important features.
- **SVM** is used to classify the transformed data due to its effectiveness in high-dimensional spaces.

## Tools
- Python
- NumPy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib
- OpenCV
